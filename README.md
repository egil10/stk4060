[![Course Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/Course-STK4060-blue)](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/STK4060/index-eng.html)

Repository for **STK4060 – Time Series** course at the University of Oslo. This course covers the main models and techniques for analyzing time-correlated data, including ARMA processes, spectral analysis, and state-space models.

## Course Information

- **Course Code**: STK4060
- **Credits**: 10
- **Level**: Master
- **Teaching Language**: English
- **Course Page**: [STK4060 – Time Series](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/STK4060/index-eng.html)

### Course Content

- Estimation and testing of hypothesis with autoregressive processes and moving averages (ARMA processes)
- Stationary processes
- Correlogram, periodogram, and spectrum
- State-space models (Kalman filter)
- Illustration on real data

### Learning Outcome

You learn about the main models and techniques to analyze data where the time dimension is important. This is a useful basis to evaluate how time-correlated data should be treated.
